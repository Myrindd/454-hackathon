- apparently the entropy of sequences is high in yeast genome (almost maximal).


# DNA fingerprinting/identification

[WebMD blog](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dna-fingerprinting-overview)
- Human DNA is 99.9% the same
- uses word identification in the wrong way (actually solves matching problem)


[Saad, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200713/)
- Human DNA is 99% the same
- initial methods from 1985 involve VNTR (variable numbers of tandem repeats) and STR (short tandem repeat) markers
- pick tiny bits of information from various places in the genome
- CODIS is a US system for storing DNA of convicted felons
- based on the amplification of 13 core STR loci
- uses electrophoresis to compute the number of repetitions and identify differences between individuals
- 13 sites are enough to make an identification in a database (how so?)

- MinION device developed to study bacteria
- Now applied to **re-identification** of humans by sequencing random strings
- select individual variants in DNA
- using a bayesian algorithm, compare this mix with other profiles on file (matching)
- tests show the method can validate an individualâ€™s identity after cross-checking between **60 and 300** variants
