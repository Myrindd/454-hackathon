# Expected uses of sequence data

We have listed pharma/research/epidemiologist-type clients before and expect them to be users of the secure computing facility to generate summary data (paid service).

In addition to the above, simple apps that may help the device gain initial traction can proposed.

### Virus map

Probes providing data on viruses can be used to upload samples to a warehousing backend that can answer queries about trends, incidences and prevalences.

### Face reconstruction

Reconstruct my own face (when older, when younger, etc). Predict faces of children.

### Predisposition to diseases

Compute percentiles and probabilities of disease risk.

### Longevity analysis

Compute expected lifespan.

### Ancestry

Search for relations in a (large) geographic region, compute relation to famous people (that we have on board).
